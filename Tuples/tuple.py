""""Python Tuple is used to store the sequence of immutable python objects.
Tuple is similar to lists since the value of the items stored in the list can be changed whereas the tuple is immutable and the value of the items stored in the tuple can not be changed.
"""
#tuple is immutable
#the syntax of tuple is : tupel=();
#the syntax of list is :list=[];
#we can convert list tuple and vice versa.
T1=(101,"prasad",22);
print(T1);
