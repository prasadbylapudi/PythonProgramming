There are the following advantages of C functions.

By using functions, we can avoid rewriting same logic/code again and again in a program.
We can call python functions any number of times in a program and from any place in a program.
We can track a large python program easily when it is divided into multiple functions.
Reusability is the main achievement of python functions.
However, Function calling is always overhead in a python program.


The function block is started with the colon (:) and all the same level block statements remain at the same indentation.

A function can accept any number of parameters that must be the same in the definition and function calling.
